## How to use

Your solutions should go inside `days/dayx.rs` inside functions `A()` and `B()`. The main function calls these functions. If `B` is still unimplemented, `A` should still run.

In order to start a new day, you can run:
```bash
node ./gen_day <day> <force>
```

Where `<day>` is the number of the day, and `<force>` allows you to force overwrite an already existing day.
